# LearnJavaPrograms

🚀 This repository contains a structured collection of Java programs written for learning, daily practice, and interview preparation. The programs are organized day-wise based on a 10-day Java learning roadmap — each day targeting specific core Java concepts and real-world problem-solving patterns.

---

## 📘 Structure

Each folder (Day1, Day2, ...) represents one focused learning day. Every folder includes:

- Java programs grouped by topic
- Each program contains clean, modular code (method-based)
- Console output and inline comments for clarity
- Easy to scale and review
